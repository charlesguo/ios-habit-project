### App Design

#### Objective
Casacalc calculates the relevant stamp duty taxes you need to pay when buying your first, second or (lucky you!) third residential property in Singapore so that you will always be confident in knowing the total price you have to pay.

Enter the price you are paying to the seller. Select your tax residency status (Singapore Citizen, Permanent Resident, or foreigner) and Casacalc tells you how much you need to pay in stamp duty taxes. Save your calculations so that you can refer to them later. 

#### Audience
Any would-be home-buyer who needs to know how much will the new home actually end up costing him or her.

The demographic consists of first-time home-buyers who may be unfamiliar with stamp duty laws, families interested in purchasing a second property for investment reasons, as well as seasoned property investors. All three groups will benefit from knowing how much they will actually have to pay in stamp duty taxes. 

#### Experience
As a normal user, I want to be know the breakdown of additional fees that I need to pay in addition to the purchase price.

As a power user, I will shortlist several residential properties and save them so that I can refer to them later when comparing their final costs. I can also attach a photo of each property to better remember them.

Potential Feature - Export to email or other app.
