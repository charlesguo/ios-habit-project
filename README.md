### App Design

#### Objective
Home motivates you to master good habits and keeps tracks of your progress so that you can achieve your goals.

Choose or create habits to master. Set the times to do them. Be reminded whenever there's one for you to complete. Record your progress after finishing each activity. See where you are on your road to excellence. 

#### Audience
Anyone who wants to live a healthier (fitness goals), happier (emotional and intellectual goals), and more financially-stable (monetary goals).

Within the demographic, there is a segment of users (particularly the 20-40s age group) who have the disposable income to pay for upgrades (e.g. additional habits, journalling or "coaching" functionalities) that would improve their lives and careers. 

#### Experience
As a normal user, I want to be able to keep track of some health- (e.g. exercise) and skills-/ knowledge- related (e.g. reading a book/ attending an online course) goals so that I can improve myself.

As a power user, I want to pick up and master 5 new habits a month so that I can increase my score and boast to all my friends.

#### List apps that are inspirational:
